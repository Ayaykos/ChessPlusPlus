# ChessPlusPlus

Working on a Chess spinoff, exploring where I can take this. 

- game.cpp  *//main driver*
  - game.h  *//Piece classes/subclasses*
  - grid.h  *//Grid class containing pieces*
  - helper.h  *//Helper functions for Grid's use of Pieces*
  
- tests.cpp  *//test suite - currently only calling from here during testing (main driver empty)*
  - tests_basic_moves.h
  - tests_check_paths.h
